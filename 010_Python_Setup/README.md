# Setup a Python programming environment using Anaconda

## Summary of Steps to Complete (See corresponding sections below.)

- [ ] Download and install Anaconda.
- [ ] Set up VSCode for Python programming

## Anaconda

* Download and install.
* Make sure to select a Python 3.x version.
* A graphical installer should work for most people (Windows or Mac).
* Download page may look a little different than what is shown in the videos - https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual
* Mac Example (first 8 min) - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mAmZIRfJBs&list=PLG9A6ovzPqX6d9uWzx0UYN9pm0zzl5ofA&index=8&t=868s
* Windows Example (14 min) - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5mDYijMfSzs&list=PLG9A6ovzPqX6d9uWzx0UYN9pm0zzl5ofA&index=11&t=0s
  * If this is your first time installing Python select Add Anaconda to System Path option as the presenter suggests.
  * You should already have VSCode installed on your system. You don't need to reinstall.

## 2023 Update

Technology is advancing and there are now some online options for doing Python programming in Jupyter Notebooks directly in a browser window without installing anything directly on your computer. If you have problems installing software on your computer, the options I list below may work for much of the Python programming we'll do in this course. These are both new to me this year, so I'm not very familiar with either system. If you want to try them out, we may need to troubleshoot as we go through the semester.

* Noteable.io https://noteable.io/
  * Noteable.io allows you to create a free account.
  * I signed up for Noteable using my Google account.
  * You should be able to upload our assignment files to Noteable to complete them, then download your completed assignments to turn in on GitHub. It's not a perfect solution yet, but it's an alternative to installing software on your computer.
* Google Colab https://colab.research.google.com/?utm_source=scs-index
  * Google Colab also allows you to create a free account and use Jupyter Notebooks online.
* GitHub CodeSpaces https://github.com/features/codespaces
  * GitHub CodeSpaces allows you to program using VSCode in a browser.
  * At the time I made this update, you could use up to 60 hours of CodeSpaces for free. Rates for additional time looked very reasonable. (Students may get more free time.)

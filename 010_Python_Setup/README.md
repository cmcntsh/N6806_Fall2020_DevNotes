# Setup a Python programming environment using Anaconda

## Summary of Steps to Complete (See corresponding sections below.)
- [ ] Download and install Anaconda.
- [ ] Set up VSCode for Python programming

## Anaconda
* Download and install.
* Make sure to select a Python 3.x version.
* A graphical installer should work for most people (Windows or Mac).
* Download page may look a little different than what is shown in the videos - https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual
* Mac Example (first 8 min) - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mAmZIRfJBs&list=PLG9A6ovzPqX6d9uWzx0UYN9pm0zzl5ofA&index=8&t=868s
* Windows Example (14 min) - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5mDYijMfSzs&list=PLG9A6ovzPqX6d9uWzx0UYN9pm0zzl5ofA&index=11&t=0s
  * If this is your first time installing Python select Add Anaconda to System Path option as the presenter suggests.
  * You should already have VSCode installed on your system. You don't need to reinstall.

## Set up VSCode for Python Programming
* (2022 update) A simplified version of how to set up VSCode to work with Python files: https://youtu.be/v0m2jatYvwc

  * The presenter uses a different environment manager. We're going to stick with Conda. Don't use his commands for creating new environments. (2021 update: I recommend managing environments as shown in the new Anaconda introduction video. https://anaconda.cloud/tutorials/getting-started-with-anaconda-individual-edition%3Fsource%3Dindividual-edition-tutorial)
  * The presenter demonstrates the debugger a little bit. We're not going to do much with that right now so you can just watch.
  * The presenter uses pip to install a package. We're going to stick with Conda. Don't use his commands for installing packages. I've read that sometimes switching back and forth between installing packages using Conda and Pip can create conflicts. We will try to avoid that problem by using Conda virtual environments for different projects and installing packages using Conda whenever possible. (Sometimes a package isn't available using Conda but it is in pip. In those instances it's OK to use pip.)
  * The presenter demonstrates an add-in called Kite. I've never used it. You can try it if you like.
  * The presenter demonstrates pytest. You can just watch that part. Don't worry about trying it out.

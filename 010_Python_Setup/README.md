# Setup a Python programming environment using Anaconda

## Summary of Steps to Complete (See corresponding sections below.)
- [ ] Download and install Anaconda.
- [ ] Set up VSCode for Python programming

## Anaconda
* Download and install.
* Make sure to select a Python 3.x version.
* A graphical installer should work for most people (Windows or Mac).
* Download page may look a little different than what is shown in the videos - https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual
* Mac Example (first 8 min) - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mAmZIRfJBs&list=PLG9A6ovzPqX6d9uWzx0UYN9pm0zzl5ofA&index=8&t=868s
* Windows Example (14 min) - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5mDYijMfSzs&list=PLG9A6ovzPqX6d9uWzx0UYN9pm0zzl5ofA&index=11&t=0s
  * If this is your first time installing Python select Add Anaconda to System Path option as the presenter suggests.
  * You should already have VSCode installed on your system. You don't need to reinstall.

## Set up VSCode for Python Programming
* VSCode Python Setup (22 min): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W--_EOzdTHk
  * The presenter uses a different environment manager. We're going to stick with Conda. Don't use his commands for creating new environments.
  * The presenter demonstrates the debugger a little bit. We're not going to do much with that right now so you can just watch.
  * The presenter uses pip to install a package. We're going to stick with Conda. Don't use his commands for installing packages. (Sometimes a package isn't available using Conda but it is in pip. In those instances it's OK to use pip.)
  * The presenter demonstrates an add-in called Kite. I've never used it. You can try it if you like.
  * The presenter demonstrates pytest. You can just watch that part. Don't worry about trying it out.
